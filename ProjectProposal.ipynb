The datasets contains a lot of professors’ name and specific course number ,use of which appears to be a privacy concern so we will transform those names and numbers into encrypted code that will not expose personal information. As CAPEs mainly focuses on academic datasets there is little potential biases we found that violates equitable analysis. Furthermore, in the research we will drop all the professors’ personal data, which means we focuses mainly on the overall relationship between professors’ rating and students’ GPA. Thus in our analyses there is a extremely small chance that will be problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact."

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, it could effectively help UCSD students to plan their schedule and have an idea of what grade they will receive based on the quantitative data collected in CAPE. A problem that many UCSD students encounter is that they have mismatched expectations of the difficulty and average grade received for the course. By looking at the raw data provided by CAPE, students do not really understand the internal relationships between each variable. Consequently, it is highly possible that they might underestimate the difficulty of a hard course or overestimate that of an easy course. If our hypotheses are correct, students are able to follow the relationships we found between the variables, which could give them better understanding of the course as a whole. On the other hand, if our methods don’t work or our hypotheses are wrong, it could still help students to understand what are the patterns between the variables that do not exist. This could again clear some of the misunderstandings from the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also potential pitfalls and confounds in our data that may influence our interpretations. Firstly, all the data from CAPE are filled by students from UCSD based on their personal understanding and feelings of the course. Hence, there is no control of how reflective each data is relating to the professor and course. It is possible that the professor of a course is actually a good lecturer, but many students in the course didn’t like the way the professor instructs the course, and hence leave negative feedbacks on CAPE. Moreover, since CAPE is not mandatory, the data may not reflect the image of the course as a whole. It is possible that only students with negative feelings would fill the CAPE for a particular course, and vice versa. However, since the data is large enough, we believe the likelihood of this case is relatively low. More importantly, since UCSD students are already using CAPE data to make judgements of the course, our analysis would still provide helpful and good feedbacks to provide them better understanding of each course."
